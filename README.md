## ✨ The "Ultimate UI" Core

- **Interactive Architecture Deep-Dive**  
  An exploratory 3D-layered explorer in the "About" section. Users can interact with the **Intent**, **Logic**, and **Execution** layers to reveal the underlying operational philosophy of the studio.

- **Neural Network 3.0**  
  A high-density "agentic connection" system with pulsing nodes and interactive links that react dynamically to cursor proximity and scroll depth, representing the studio's technical nervous system.

- **Secure Uplink Transmission**  
  A reimagined contact interface featuring encryption animations, data-routing sequences, and cryptographic feedback for an immersive communication experience.

- **UI "Soni-fication"**  
  High-fidelity digital audio feedback. Synthesized clicks, interactive "ticks," and a constant ambient "data hum" provide a rich tactile layer to the digital surface.

- **Atmospheric Gradience**  
  A "Midnight Vibrant" aesthetic driven by high-luminosity mesh gradients, synchronized radial glows, and liquid background engine for maximum visual depth.

- **Liquid "Gooey" Interactions**  
  SVG-filtered primary buttons and social icons that exhibit organic, liquid-like properties when under magnetic pull, breaking the rigid digital grid.

## 🤖 3-Layer Agentic Architecture

Burak Studio is architected around a scalable, modular framework that separates human intent from deterministic execution.

| Layer | Responsibility | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 1: Intent** | Directives & SOPs | Markdown-based standard operating procedures defining "What" and "Why." |
| **Layer 2: Logic** | Orchestration | The intelligent routing layer where agents interpret intent and select execution paths. |
| **Layer 3: Execution** | Deterministic Action | Idempotent Python scripts and file utilities that ensure 100% reliable outcomes. |

## 🚀 Tech Stack

| Category | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Foundation** | Semantic HTML5 (Clean, Accessible, SEO-Ready) |
| **Styling** | Modern CSS3 (3D Transforms, Mix-Blends, GPU Shaders) |
| **Logic** | Vanilla JavaScript (Event-Driven, Zero-Dependency, 60fps) |
| **Audio Engine** | Web Audio API (Real-time Synthesis & LFO Modulation) |
| **Automation** | Python 3.10+ (Deployment & Intelligent Asset Engines) |
| **Branding** | Faceted SVG (Infinite Scalability & Resolution Independence) |
