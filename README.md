## ✨ The "Ultimate UI" Core

- **Interactive Architecture Deep-Dive**  
  An exploratory 3D-layered explorer in the "About" section. Users can interact with the **Intent**, **Logic**, and **Execution** layers to reveal the underlying operational philosophy.

- **Neural Network 3.0**  
  A high-density "agentic connection" system with pulsing nodes and interactive links that react to cursor proximity, representing the invisible logic of the studio.

- **Secure Uplink Transmission**  
  A reimagined contact interface featuring encryption animations, data-routing sequences, and cryptographic feedback for an immersive communication experience.

- **Audio Micro-interactions**  
  High-fidelity digital "clicks," interactive "ticks," and a synthesized ambient "data hum" providing subtle tactile feedback as you navigate the flagship.

- **Liquid "Gooey" Interactions**  
  SVG-filtered primary buttons that exhibit organic, liquid-like properties when under magnetic pull, providing a highly tactile and immersive feedback loop.

- **Cinematic Mask Reveal**  
  Advanced content entry using `clip-path` masks and staggered timing. Every element enters the stage with cinematic precision.

## 🤖 3-Layer Agentic Architecture

Burak Studio is built on a structured framework that separates high-level intent from low-level execution, ensuring that AI-driven changes are deterministic, safe, and scalable.

| Layer | Responsibility | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 1: Intent** | Directives & SOPs | Markdown-based standard operating procedures that define the "What" and "Why." |
| **Layer 2: Logic** | Orchestration | The routing layer where agents interpret directives and select the optimal execution path. |
| **Layer 3: Execution** | Deterministic Action | Idempotent Python scripts that perform the actual work with 100% reliability. |

## 🚀 Tech Stack

| Category | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Foundation** | Semantic HTML5 (Accessibility & SEO Focused) |
| **Styling** | Modern CSS3 (Variables, Mix-Blends, 3D Transforms) |
| **Logic** | Vanilla JavaScript (GPU-Accelerated & Debounced) |
| **Automation** | Python 3.10+ (Deployment & Asset Engines) |
| **Assets** | Pure SVG (Infinite Scalability & Zero Latency) |
| **Deployment** | GitHub Pages / Vercel Edge Ready |
