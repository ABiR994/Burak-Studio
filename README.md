## ✨ The "Ultimate UI" Core

- **Neural Network Background**  
  A live-calculated "agentic connection" system where nodes and links respond dynamically to cursor proximity. It represents the invisible logic that powers modern digital orchestration.

- **Text Scramble & Decrypt**  
  Sophisticated character-cycling animations for section headers that simulate real-time AI data processing. It brings a sense of high-intent computation to every interaction.

- **Liquid "Gooey" Interactions**  
  SVG-filtered primary buttons that exhibit organic, liquid-like properties when under magnetic pull, providing a highly tactile and immersive feedback loop.

- **Staggered Mask Reveal**  
  Advanced content entry using `clip-path` masks and staggered timing. Every element enters the stage with cinematic precision, ensuring a synchronized and premium visual flow.

- **Atmospheric Depth of Field**  
  Dynamic blurring of geometric background elements based on their parallax Z-depth. This creates a realistic 3D camera effect that adds infinite depth to the "Midnight" aesthetic.

- **Deterministic Optimization**  
  No frameworks. No bloat. Pure, optimized Vanilla JavaScript and CSS3 properties ensure zero layout-thrashing and maximum efficiency across all devices.

## 🤖 3-Layer Agentic Architecture

Burak Studio is built on a structured framework that separates high-level intent from low-level execution, ensuring that AI-driven changes are deterministic, safe, and scalable.

| Layer | Responsibility | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 1: Intent** | Directives & SOPs | Markdown-based standard operating procedures that define the "What" and "Why." |
| **Layer 2: Logic** | Orchestration | The routing layer where agents interpret directives and select the optimal execution path. |
| **Layer 3: Execution** | Deterministic Action | Idempotent Python scripts that perform the actual work with 100% reliability. |

## 🚀 Tech Stack

| Category | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Foundation** | Semantic HTML5 (Accessibility & SEO Focused) |
| **Styling** | Modern CSS3 (Variables, Mix-Blends, 3D Transforms) |
| **Logic** | Vanilla JavaScript (GPU-Accelerated & Debounced) |
| **Automation** | Python 3.10+ (Deployment & Asset Engines) |
| **Assets** | Pure SVG (Infinite Scalability & Zero Latency) |
| **Deployment** | GitHub Pages / Vercel Edge Ready |
